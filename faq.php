      <h1>Frequently Asked Question</h1>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>Can a landlord raise my rent during my stay?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>Landlords are allowed to raise the rent once the lease has expired. If you decide to stay in the same apartment next year, you should read your new lease carefully and make sure the rates haven't gone up.</i>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>What is the difference between a month-to-month and a fixed-term lease?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>A fixed-term lease is an agreement that states the tenant will remain in the apartment or home for a pre-determined amount of time — usually a year. Month-to-month leases also tend to have higher rent prices because the landlord is not guaranteed income for the next month. Unless you are in a precarious or time-sensitive situation, it's often a better financial call to go with the fixed-term lease.</i>

        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>I want make some changes to my apartment decoration. How far can I go?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>Making simple aesthetic changes, like swapping furniture, is not a problem (unless you rented a furnished unit). But if you want to make changes to the apartment itself — like painting or mounting some shelves on the wall — you will need to check the terms of your lease.</i>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>I got a pet and my landlord doesn't know about it. What should I do?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>If pets are allowed in your building, let the landlord know immediately. You will likely have to put down an extra pet deposit or tack on a fee to your monthly rent to cover for potential property damages. If pets are not allowed in your building, you will likely either have to move out or get rid of the pet. All buildings have the right to forbid pets, aside from support animals.</i>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>What kind of exterior maintenance will I be responsible for?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>Your level of responsibility for the exterior of the house depends on what kind of rental you have and the terms dictated in the lease. If you live in a large apartment complex, the courtyard will often be cared for — whether it be lawn mowing or snow shoveling — by the building's maintenance team. If you live in a house, you are often responsible for the yard maintenance.</i>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>Are landlords required to make repairs?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>Landlords are required to make routine repairs in a timely fashion, no matter how small. Major repairs that compromise day-to-day living for tenants should be a top priority. If your landlord does not respond to your first request, then send a second request with a repair deadline.</i>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>What happens when I don't pay rent on time?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>Always be sure to communicate with your landlord. Telling them that your rent is coming late might be a bit embarrassing, but it's much better than sending a check that will bounce or just not paying the rent at all. Keep in mind that if you don't pay rent on time continuously, the landlord has the right to issue an eviction notice.</i>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>I need to move out early and break the terms of my lease. How does this work?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>Regardless of the reason, breaking the terms of a lease is never an ideal situation. Often a lease will include an early-release clause, which requests one or two months rent from the tenant after they vacate. If there are no terms, you'll need to negotiate with your landlord.</i>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>What repairs is my landlord responsible for, and what repairs am I responsible for?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>As a generalization, landlords are usually responsible for all repairs except extremely small ones, such as changing lightbulbs. If you have asked your landlord to fix something or repair something that's their responsibility but they are refusing, depending on the laws in your state, you may sue the landlord for personal injuries, including pain or suffering as a result of defective housing conditions.</i>

      <div class="faq-details">
        <h2><span class="quote">"</span>Am I entitled to know if anything bad happened in the unit before I was here?<span class="quote">"</span></h2><br>
        <i>What happened in a house or apartment before you rented it — called disclosure laws — varies depending on what state and area you reside in. Some areas require landlords to fully disclose, while other areas just require disclosure of violent deaths. Many areas have an expiration date on event disclosure.</i>
